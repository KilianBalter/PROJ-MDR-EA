The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.\nSymbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them.

Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember.

At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.

If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

IPsec Services could not be started. 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces.

Windows Store apps can't access OneDrive using theWinRTAPI. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud.

Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that template are worth your consideration: \r\n\r\nAllow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations- a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to onlyapprovedtenant IDs. Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts- a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Windows readiness level for each new Windows 10 Feature Update is classified in one of 5 categories, depending on your organizations level of comfort with receiving them:  Preview Build - Fast: Devices set to this level will be the first to receive new builds of Windows with features not yet available to the general public. Select Fast to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft, and provide suggestions on new functionality.  Preview Build - Slow: Devices set to this level receive new builds of Windows before they are available to the general public, but at a slower cadence than those set to Fast, and with changes and fixes identified in earlier builds.  Release Preview: Receive builds of Windows just before Microsoft releases them to the general public.  Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted): Receive feature updates when they are released to the general public.  Semi-Annual Channel: Feature updates will arrive when they are declared Semi-Annual Channel. This usually occurs about 4 months after Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), indicating that Microsoft, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), partners and customer believe that the release is ready for broad deployment.  The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days.  Note: If the \"Allow Telemetry\" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.  Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior calledDual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management.

If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting toNot Configuredorconfigure the settingDo not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update(added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering.

The available methods are: \r\n\r\nThe B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts. The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server (WINS). The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if broadcast failed. The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if the query failed. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended)(point-to-point). \r\n\r\nNote: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If theNodeTyperegistry value is present, it overrides anyDhcpNodeTyperegistry value. If neitherNodeTypenorDhcpNodeTypeis present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server configured. \r\n\r\n",

Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. \r\n\r\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \r\n\r\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner. All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.

            "description": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: \r\n\r\nJoin a domainAuthenticate between Active Directory forestsAuthenticate to down-level domainsAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XPAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domainThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. \r\n\r\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM. \r\n\r\n",

            "rationale": "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. \r\n\r\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible. \r\n\r\n",

Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. \r\n\r\nSMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place. \r\n\r\n",

That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated. \r\n\r\nThe Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. \r\n\r\nImplementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. \r\n\r\nWhen SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
